Deriving code, example and experience with Robotics from the Elegoo Tumbller

This repository builds on Elegoo's really engaging education robot "Tumbller". The [original code from Elegoo](https://github.com/elegooofficial/ELEGOO-TumbllerV1.1-Self-Balancing-Car-Tutorial/tree/main) is added here in the `elegoo` branch, untouched for reference as the original repo features an inconvenient ZIP archive instead of code (and there is no explicit license). Other branches here derive from Elegoo's original work. They aim to add functionalities.
